# Cursor Rules System

This directory contains modular rule files that guide AI-assisted development for the Syntheverse project. These rules ensure consistency, quality, and adherence to project standards across all code contributions.

## Structure

### General Rules
- `general.md` - Core coding standards and best practices
- `python.md` - Python-specific conventions and patterns
- `typescript.md` - TypeScript/Next.js conventions
- `solidity.md` - Solidity smart contract standards

### Component-Specific Rules
- `api.md` - API development (Flask, FastAPI)
- `blockchain.md` - Blockchain and smart contract development
- `frontend.md` - Frontend development (Next.js, React)
- `layer2.md` - Layer 2 evaluation and tokenomics
- `rag.md` - RAG API and document processing
- `testing.md` - Testing standards and practices
- `documentation.md` - Documentation standards

### Architecture Rules
- `architecture.md` - System architecture constraints
- `data-flow.md` - Data flow and integration patterns
- `security.md` - Security best practices

## Usage

The root `.cursorrules` file references these modular rules. When working in specific areas of the codebase, the relevant rule files provide context-specific guidance.

## Principles

1. **Modularity** - Rules are organized by concern for easy maintenance
2. **Specificity** - Each file focuses on a specific domain or technology
3. **Consistency** - All rules align with project standards and user preferences
4. **Completeness** - Rules cover all aspects of development in the Syntheverse ecosystem
