# General Coding Standards

## Core Principles

### Code Quality
- Write clear, concise, and maintainable code
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Remove redundant code and unused imports
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs and complex logic
- Use clear, understated language ("show not tell")
- Include docstrings for functions, classes, and modules
- Keep comments focused on "why" not "what"

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names that convey purpose
- Avoid unnecessary adjectives (e.g., "enhanced", "real", "new")
- Use consistent naming patterns across the codebase
- Prefer full words over abbreviations

### Code Organization
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Organize code into logical modules
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use appropriate design patterns

### Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully with informative messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Validate inputs at boundaries

### Performance
- Optimize for readability first, performance second
- Profile before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Consider scalability in design

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) when appropriate
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios
- Keep tests maintainable and readable

### Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Make atomic commits
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Review changes before committing
