# Test Outputs Agents

## Purpose

Storage and management of test execution outputs, blockchain state, and evaluation reports for Syntheverse testing.

## Key Modules

### Blockchain State (`blockchain/`)

- **Chain Data**: Complete blockchain chain with all blocks and transactions
- **Token Contract State**: SYNTH token contract state and epoch balances
- **POD Contract State**: Proof-of-Discovery contract state and submission records

### Evaluation Reports (`pod_reports/`)

- **Individual Reports**: Per-submission evaluation results and metrics
- **PoD Scores**: Coherence, density, novelty, and composite scoring
- **Token Allocations**: Epoch, tier, and reward amount calculations
- **Blockchain Status**: Network state at time of evaluation

### Submission History (`submissions_history.json`)

- **Complete Records**: All test submissions with metadata
- **Evaluation Results**: Scoring and qualification status
- **Allocation Details**: Token distribution and reward tracking
- **Status Tracking**: Submission approval and processing status

### Tokenomics State (`l2_tokenomics_state.json`)

- **Layer 2 State**: Tokenomics calculations and balance tracking
- **Epoch Management**: Distribution and availability tracking
- **Allocation History**: Historical reward distribution records

## Integration Points

- Test outputs generated by test suites in `tests/`
- Blockchain state connects to Layer 1 in `src/blockchain/layer1/`
- Evaluation reports produced by Layer 2 in `src/core/layer2/`
- Submission data validated by test scripts

## Development Guidelines

- Maintain consistent output formats across tests
- Include comprehensive metadata in all outputs
- Ensure outputs are properly excluded from version control
- Document output structure for test validation
- Clean up outputs between test runs when appropriate

## Common Patterns

- JSON-formatted output files
- Structured metadata inclusion
- Hierarchical organization by test type
- Comprehensive state tracking
- Historical data preservation
