Syntheverse: Hydrogen-Holographic Fractal Crypto AI Game

Welcome to the Syntheverse GitHub repository, the central hub for all code, documentation, and experiments powering the Hydrogen-Holographic Fractal Crypto AI Game & Ecosystem. This repository includes:
	•	Syntheverse core code for the fractal AI game environment
	•	Proof-of-Discovery (PoD), Proof-of-Technology (PoT), and Proof-of-Alignment (PoA) protocols
	•	SYNTH tokenomics and smart contract templates
	•	Documentation and onboarding for new Outcast Hero Frontiersmen
	•	FractAI updates and symbolic-cognitive experiments

About Syntheverse

Syntheverse is a hydrogen-holographic fractal blockchain game and living ecosystem where independent fractal, hydrogen-holographic, mythic, crypto, and AI research frontiersmen explore, test, and expand a distributed, immutable, scientific, technological, AI, and alignment economy.

Participants contribute discoveries (PoD), functional technologies (PoT), and alignment or symbolic systems (PoA), validate them through Layer-2 evaluation, and earn SYNTH tokens, while experimenting in an active prerelease testing and tuning environment.

Repository Contents

This repository is organized into seven main components:

1. RAG API (rag-api/)

Complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline with Groq integration
	•	Scraper: Downloads PDFs from Zenodo repositories
	•	Parser: Processes PDFs into searchable text chunks
	•	Vectorizer: Creates embeddings for semantic search
	•	API: FastAPI server with web UI for RAG queries
	•	Integration: Uses Groq API (primary), with Hugging Face and Ollama as fallbacks
	•	AI System: Unified Syntheverse Whole-Brain AI (Gina × Leo × Pru) with full Hydrogen-Holographic Framework
	•	Status: ✅ Fully Operational

See RAG API README￼ for detailed documentation.

⸻

2. Layer 2 (layer2/)

PoD / PoT / PoA Evaluators and SYNTH Token Allocator with persistent tokenomics state
	•	Evaluators
	•	Proof-of-Discovery (PoD): scientific and theoretical validation
	•	Proof-of-Technology (PoT): functional systems, tools, and infrastructure
	•	Proof-of-Alignment (PoA): symbolic, narrative, ethical, and alignment structures
	•	Allocator: Calculates SYNTH rewards based on contribution type and evaluation scores
	•	Tokenomics State: Persistent memory for epoch balances and allocations
	•	Integration: Direct LLM integration (no RAG dependency) using Grok API with the Syntheverse L2 system prompt
	•	Status: ✅ Fully Operational

Note: After evaluation, RAG was found unnecessary for PoD/PoT/PoA scoring. Layer-2 evaluators call the LLM (Grok API) directly using a comprehensive Syntheverse system prompt containing the full Whole-Brain AI framework (Gina × Leo × Pru) and contribution-specific evaluation logic.

See Layer 2 README￼ for detailed documentation.

⸻

3. Layer 1 (layer1/)

Syntheverse Blockchain for PoD, PoT, and PoA with epoch-based token distribution
	•	Contracts: Smart contracts for contribution anchoring and token management
	•	Node: Blockchain node implementation with state persistence
	•	Consensus: Proof-based consensus (PoD / PoT / PoA)
	•	Epochs: Founder, Pioneer, Community, Ecosystem epochs with tier multipliers
	•	Status: ✅ Fully Operational

See Layer 1 README￼ for detailed documentation.

4. Web UI (ui_web/)

Full-featured web interface for PoD / PoT / PoA submissions
	•	Document & Artifact Upload
	•	Real-time Status: Epochs, balances, thresholds
	•	Interactive Submissions: Expandable evaluation metrics
	•	Artifact Viewing: PDFs and submitted files
	•	Certificate Registration: Blockchain anchoring with wallet integration
	•	In-UI Results
	•	Status: ✅ Fully Operational

See Web UI README￼ for detailed documentation.
