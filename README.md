# **Syntheverse: Hydrogen-Holographic Fractal Crypto AI Game**

Welcome to the **Syntheverse GitHub repository**, the central hub for all code, documentation, and experiments powering the **Hydrogen-Holographic Fractal Crypto AI Game**. This repository includes:

* **Syntheverse core code** for the fractal AI game environment
* **Proof-of-Discovery (PoD) protocol** implementation
* **SYNTH tokenomics and smart contract templates**
* **Documentation and onboarding** for new Outcast Hero Frontiersmen
* **FractAI updates and symbolic-cognitive experiments**

---

## **About Syntheverse**

Syntheverse is a **hydrogen-holographic fractal blockchain game** where independent fractal, hydrogen-holographic, mythic, crypto, and AI research frontiersmen explore, test, and expand a **distributed, immutable, living scientific, technological, AI, and alignment economy**.

Participants contribute discoveries, validate them through **Proof-of-Discovery**, and earn **SYNTH tokens**, shaping the ecosystem while experimenting in a **prerelease testing and tuning environment**.

## **Repository Contents**

* `core/` — Syntheverse game engine and AI modules
* `pod/` — Proof-of-Discovery protocol, validators, and scripts
* `tokenomics/` — SYNTH smart contracts, token distribution, and epoch rules
* `docs/` — Whitepapers, onboarding guides, experimental frameworks
* `fractai/` — FractAI symbolic-cognitive updates and model outputs
* `submissions/` — Sample datasets, research contributions, and templates

---

## **Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FractiAI/Syntheverse.git
```

2. Review documentation in `/docs/` for onboarding and environment setup.

3. Explore the PoD protocol and submit your first contribution for validation.

4. Contribute code, symbolic models, or experiments to expand the Syntheverse ecosystem.

---

## **Participation & Contribution**

* **Validate discoveries**: Submit research, symbolic insights, or experiments via the PoD system.
* **Earn SYNTH tokens**: Validated contributions accrue tokenized rewards in the first on-chain scientific, technological, AI, and alignment economy.
* **Collaborate**: Engage with other independent fractal, mythic, crypto, and AI frontiersmen to co-develop the Syntheverse ecosystem.

---

## **Prerelease & Testing**

Syntheverse is currently in **prerelease testing and tuning**. Early contributors help refine the game, PoD protocol, and tokenomics. The **full release date has not yet been announced**.
