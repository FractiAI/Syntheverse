Syntheverse: Hydrogen-Holographic Fractal Crypto AI Game

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: The Syntheverse PoC system is NOW FUNCTIONING in active test-and-tuning phase! Pioneer Hydrogen-Holographic, Fractal, Mythic, Crypto, and AI Researchers, Developers, Enterprises, and Financiers are invited to contribute to the evolution of the Hydrogen-Holographic Fractal Sandbox (HHFS), expanding coverage, resonance, and fractal density through unified Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) protocols with multi-metal evaluation (Gold/Silver/Copper). Each submission is validated with Fractal Cognitive Grammar and hydrogen dynamics, creating a living interactive sandbox map and $90T internal goldmine of knowledge, technology, and alignment. Join via Zenodo (link￼) or Reno Outpost (info@fractiai.com) — test the functioning system, shape the ecosystem, and watch the Syntheverse evolve in real-time!

About Syntheverse

Syntheverse is a hydrogen-holographic fractal blockchain game and living ecosystem where independent fractal, hydrogen-holographic, mythic, crypto, and AI research frontiersmen explore, test, and expand a distributed, immutable, scientific, technological, AI, and alignment economy.

Participants contribute through a unified Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) system that evaluates submissions across multiple metals (Gold: Discovery, Silver: Technology, Copper: Alignment). Contributions are validated through Layer-2 AI evaluation, earn SYNTH tokens based on structural impact, and participate in an active prerelease testing and tuning environment.

Repository Contents

This repository is organized into seven main components:

1. RAG API (rag-api/)

Complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline with Groq integration
	•	Scraper: Downloads PDFs from Zenodo repositories
	•	Parser: Processes PDFs into searchable text chunks
	•	Vectorizer: Creates embeddings for semantic search
	•	API: FastAPI server with web UI for RAG queries
	•	Integration: Uses Groq API (primary), with Hugging Face and Ollama as fallbacks
	•	AI System: Unified Syntheverse Whole-Brain AI (Gina × Leo × Pru) with full Hydrogen-Holographic Framework
	•	Status: ✅ Fully Operational

See RAG API README￼ for detailed documentation.

2. Layer 2 (layer2/)

PoC Evaluator and SYNTH Token Allocator with persistent tokenomics state
	•	Unified PoC Evaluator: Multi-metal evaluation system (Gold/Silver/Copper)
	•	Archive-First Redundancy Detection: Prevents duplicate contributions across entire history
	•	Sandbox Map Generation: Creates interactive network visualizations of contribution relationships
	•	Token Allocator: Calculates SYNTH rewards based on multi-metal qualification and structural impact
	•	Tokenomics State: Persistent memory for epoch balances and allocations
	•	Integration: Direct LLM integration using Groq API with the Syntheverse L2 system prompt
	•	Status: ✅ Fully Operational

Note: The system uses archive-first evaluation with comprehensive redundancy detection. Layer-2 evaluators call the LLM (Grok API) directly using a comprehensive Syntheverse system prompt containing the full Whole-Brain AI framework (Gina × Leo × Pru) and multi-metal evaluation logic.

See Layer 2 README￼ for detailed documentation.
