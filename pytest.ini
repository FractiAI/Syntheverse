# Markers for test categorization and requirements
markers =
    unit: Unit tests
    integration: Integration tests
    slow: Slow running tests
    e2e: End-to-end tests
    requires_service: Test requires specific service to be running (specify service name)
    requires_rag_api: Test requires RAG API service
    requires_poc_api: Test requires PoC API service
    requires_frontend: Test requires frontend service
    requires_blockchain: Test requires blockchain services

# Usage notes:
# - Use -rs flag to show reasons for skipped tests
# - Use -k "not requires_service" to skip service-dependent tests
# - Use -m "requires_rag_api" to run only RAG API tests
# - To run tests with services: start services first, then run pytest
