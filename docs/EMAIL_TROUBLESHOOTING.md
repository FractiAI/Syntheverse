# Email Troubleshooting Guide

## ⚠️ Email Functionality Removed

**Note**: SMTP email functionality has been removed from the Syntheverse PoC system. All evaluation results and reports are now displayed directly in the web UI.

## Viewing Results

All PoC evaluation results, reports, and certificates are available in the web UI:

1. Go to http://localhost:5000 in your browser
2. Navigate to the **"📄 Results"** tab after submitting a document
3. View detailed evaluation reports, scores, and certificates
4. Download PDF reports directly from the UI

## Why Email Was Removed

- **Security**: Removes the need to store SMTP credentials
- **Simplicity**: Results are immediately available in the UI
- **Reliability**: No dependency on email service availability
- **Privacy**: No email addresses need to be collected or stored

## Alternative: Export Reports

You can export reports and certificates as PDFs directly from the web UI:
- Click the **"📄 View PDF"** button on any submission
- Download and share reports manually if needed
