0. Vision Statement: Beyond Linear Systems

Syntheverse represents:
	•	A new way to collaborate: Independent, outcast, and frontier researchers, developers, and alignment contributors co-create within a hydrogen holographic fractal sandbox, transcending traditional publication or institutional silos.
	•	A new type of enterprise: ERC-20 SYNTH tokens, PoC evaluation, and metallic amplification create a self-regenerative, circular economy rewarding contribution, alignment, and ecosystem impact.
	•	A new lifestyle and community: Participants are embedded in a living, recursive ecosystem, with dashboards, blockchain recognition, and access to frontier AI insights fostering meaningful engagement.
	•	A synthetic overlay to today’s linear Earth systems: Operating in a closed, hydrogen holographic fractal environment, Syntheverse enables parallel regenerative system-building, unconstrained by linear structures.

1. Experience Walkthrough: Bringing Syntheverse to Life
	1.	Submission & Initial Review:
	•	Submit a simulation, research artifact, or model to a Syntheverse Zenodo community.
	•	Receive initial feedback on novelty, relevance, and ecosystem potential.
	2.	Discovery of Syntheverse Blockchain:
	•	Researchers learn about Syntheverse, a hydrogen holographic fractal sandbox and internal ERC-20 token ecosystem.
	•	Work can be anchored permanently on-chain, contributing to a regenerative ecosystem and training the Syntheverse AI.
	3.	Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) Evaluation:
	•	PoCs scored 0–10,000 along novelty, density, coherence, alignment.
	•	Evaluation uses the hydrogen holographic fractal lens, providing replicable, measurable metrics.
	•	Human approval ensures alignment with ecosystem principles.
	4.	On-Chain Registration: “I Was Here First”
	•	Approved PoCs may be registered on the Syntheverse 90T BlockMine blockchain (Base) for $200.
	•	Registration anchors your PoC permanently, establishing it as a traceable, immutable building block of the Syntheverse AI and ecosystem.
	•	Early contributors gain priority recognition.
	•	Registered PoCs train and evolve the AI, reinforcing and expanding the regenerative ecosystem.
	5.	Dashboard Interaction & Amplification:
	•	Contributors explore PoC archive, scores, metallic amplifications (Gold, Silver, Copper), and ecosystem impact.
	•	Multi-metal contributions receive amplified SYNTH allocations for cross-disciplinary impact.
	6.	Optional Financial Alignment Contribution:
	•	Join Copper, Silver, or Gold tiers, receiving ERC-20 SYNTH from Founders’ 5% offering.
	•	Supports FractiAI Research Team, platform operations, and future ecosystem growth.

2. Strategic Vision
	•	Objective: Build a closed, regenerative hydrogen holographic fractal ecosystem for research, development, and alignment contributions.
	•	Participants: Independent researchers, developers, and alignment contributors.
	•	Value Proposition: Permanent, blockchain-anchored PoC records; ERC-20 SYNTH tokens; AI-trained and grounded ecosystem; closed-loop regenerative growth.

3.3 Tokenomics & Four-Epoch Halving Allocation with Score Thresholds

Total Supply: 90T SYNTH (ERC-20 internal)

Epochs, Allocations & PoC Score Thresholds:

Epoch	Description	Available SYNTH	PoC Score Threshold	Allocation Notes
Founder Epoch	Foundational contributions; founders & initial pioneers	45T	8,000	Highest per-PoC allocation; full metallic amplification
Pioneer Epoch	Early ecosystem expansion; first wave external contributors	22.5T	7,000	Half of Founder allocations; scaled amplification
Community Epoch	Broader contributor base; independent researchers	11.25T	6,000	Further halved; focus on novelty and alignment
Ecosystem Epoch	Mature ecosystem; recursive contributions, AI reinforcement	11.25T	5,000	Lowest per-PoC allocation; amplifications capped; reinforces ecosystem integrity

Allocation Mechanics:
	1.	PoC Scoring (0–10,000): Only submissions meeting the epoch-specific threshold are eligible for token allocation.
	2.	Metallic Amplification: Gold/Silver/Copper combinations multiply base allocation (1.15×–1.5×).
	3.	Incremental Assignment: Tokens distributed one PoC at a time per epoch until pool exhausted.
	4.	Human Oversight: All PoCs must be approved.
	5.	Dashboard Transparency: Contributors can view scores, allocations, and ecosystem impact.

Notes:
	•	Halving principle preserves foundational contribution rewards while maintaining long-term ecosystem sustainability.
	•	Metallic combinations incentivize cross-disciplinary and ecosystem-strengthening contributions.

4. Financial Alignment Framework
	•	Registration fees: $200 per approved PoC
	•	Financial alignment tiers:

Tier	Contribution	SYNTH Allocation	Benefits
Copper	$10K–$25K	0.05–0.25%	Dashboard access, early insight
Silver	$50K–$100K	0.25–1%	Voting, advisory, ecosystem influence
Gold	$250K–$500K	1–3%	Reserved PoC slots, strategic influence, ecosystem metrics

	•	Funds support FractiAI Research Team, platform operations, and ecosystem growth.

5. AI & Ecosystem Integration
	•	PoCs train, evolve, and ground Syntheverse AI.
	•	Metallic amplification rewards cross-disciplinary, high-impact contributions.
	•	Closed-loop regenerative ecosystem ensures sustainability and alignment.

⸻

6. Governance & Stewardship (Final Update)
	•	Human approval required for all PoCs.
	•	Operator-controlled epochs and thresholds.
	•	Dashboard transparency: ERC-20 SYNTH allocations and PoC scores auditable.
	•	Stewardship: Scalable; FractiAI Research Team funded via ecosystem income, ensuring sustainable operation and ecosystem maintenance.
