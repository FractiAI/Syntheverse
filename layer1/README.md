# Layer 1 - Syntheverse Blockchain

Base blockchain implementation for Proof-of-Discovery (POD) protocol and SYNTH token management.

## Components

### Contracts (`contracts/`)
- Smart contracts for POD submissions
- SYNTH token contract
- Token distribution and reward mechanisms
- Governance contracts

### Node (`node/`)
- Blockchain node implementation
- Transaction processing
- Block creation and validation
- Network consensus participation

### Consensus (`consensus/`)
- Consensus mechanism implementation
- Block validation rules
- Network synchronization
- Fork resolution

## Status

🚧 **In Development** - Component scaffolding created, implementation pending.

## Architecture

- **Consensus**: Proof-of-Discovery (PoD) consensus mechanism
- **Token**: SYNTH token for rewards and governance
- **Storage**: Immutable POD submission records
- **Integration**: Receives token allocation instructions from Layer 2
