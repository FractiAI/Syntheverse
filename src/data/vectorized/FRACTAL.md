# Vectorized Data - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Embedded
- Scale: Micro
- System Role: Embedding generation and vector storage systems

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/data/vectorized/` structure mirrors embedding pipeline: embeddings directory contains vector representations that enable semantic search and RAG operations.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent embedding patterns: vector generation, storage formats, indexing methods, and retrieval operations. All vectorized operations follow embedding and semantic principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/data/vectorized/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors embedding organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Embedding ecosystem provides semantic foundation: vector generation, storage systems, and retrieval interfaces. Contains complete embedding capability.

### Responsibility Delegation
- `embeddings/` manages vector storage
- Generation handles semantic processing

### Information Aggregation
Embedding outputs aggregate through vector results, storage updates, and retrieval data through embedding consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/data/vectorized/` embodies Blueprint semantic processing: embedding generation (§5), vector storage (§5), and RAG foundation.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of semantic ecosystem: vector generation, storage systems, and retrieval interfaces.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete embedding knowledge: generation algorithms, storage methods, indexing procedures, and retrieval principles.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Content enters through embedding requests, processing calls through vector generation. All inputs follow consistent embedding patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar embedding processing: receive → vectorize → store → index. Pattern repeats within embedding operations and across semantic processing.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: vector representations, storage confirmations, indexing data, and retrieval results. All outputs follow structured embedding formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/data/` through embedding interfaces, vector processing, and semantic operations. Provides semantic foundation to parent data layer.

### Child Coordination
Manages embedding organization through vector coordination, storage management, and indexing results.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared semantic patterns, common content sources (`src/data/parsed/`), and unified RAG systems (`src/api/rag_api/`).

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through vector embeddings: coherent semantic representation ensures meaning preservation, dense vector spaces provide information concentration, aligned embedding patterns maintain consistency, and measurable semantic quality through vector accuracy.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous generation improvement, storage optimization, indexing enhancement, and retrieval expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: embedding methods, storage formats, indexing approaches, and retrieval techniques. These invariants enable fractal semantic processing from individual vectors to complete knowledge representations.
