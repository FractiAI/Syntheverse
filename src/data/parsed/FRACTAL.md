# Parsed Content - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Processed
- Scale: Micro
- System Role: Extracted and processed document content storage

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/data/parsed/` contains extracted text content that transforms raw PDFs into processable information.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent parsing patterns: text extraction, content organization, format standardization, and processing results. All parsed operations follow content processing principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/data/parsed/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors processing organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Content parsing provides processed information: text extraction, format conversion, and content organization. Contains complete parsing capability.

### Responsibility Delegation
- Text extraction manages content processing
- Organization enables information access

### Information Aggregation
Parsing outputs aggregate through extraction results, content organization, and processing data through parsing consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/data/parsed/` embodies Blueprint content processing: document parsing (§5), content extraction (§5), and information preparation.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of content processing: text extraction, format conversion, and information organization.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete parsing knowledge: extraction algorithms, format methods, organization procedures, and processing principles.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Raw documents enter through parsing requests, processing calls through extraction operations. All inputs follow consistent parsing patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar parsing processing: receive → extract → organize → store. Pattern repeats within parsing operations and across content processing.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: extracted text, organized content, processing metadata, and storage results. All outputs follow structured parsing formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/data/` through parsing interfaces, content processing, and information operations. Provides content foundation to parent data layer.

### Child Coordination
Manages parsing organization through extraction coordination, content management, and processing results.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared processing patterns, common document sources (`src/data/pdfs/`), and unified embeddings (`src/data/vectorized/`).

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through content parsing: coherent text extraction ensures information preservation, dense content organization provides information concentration, aligned processing patterns maintain consistency, and measurable parsing quality through extraction accuracy.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous extraction improvement, processing optimization, organization enhancement, and parsing expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: extraction methods, format standards, organization approaches, and processing techniques. These invariants enable fractal content parsing from individual documents to complete information systems.
