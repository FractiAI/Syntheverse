# Metadata Extraction - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Contextual
- Scale: Micro
- System Role: Scraping metadata and contextual information storage

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/data/metadata/` contains scraping metadata that provides context and provenance information for document processing.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent metadata patterns: extraction methods, context organization, provenance tracking, and information management. All metadata operations follow contextual and provenance principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/data/metadata/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors metadata organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Metadata ecosystem provides contextual foundation: extraction systems, context management, and provenance tracking. Contains complete metadata capability.

### Responsibility Delegation
- Extraction manages context gathering
- Organization enables information access

### Information Aggregation
Metadata outputs aggregate through extraction results, context organization, and provenance data through metadata consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/data/metadata/` embodies Blueprint contextual processing: metadata extraction (§5), provenance tracking (§5), and information context.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of contextual ecosystem: extraction systems, context management, and provenance tracking.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete metadata knowledge: extraction algorithms, context methods, provenance procedures, and tracking principles.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Sources enter through extraction requests, context calls through metadata operations. All inputs follow consistent metadata patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar metadata processing: source → extract → organize → track. Pattern repeats within metadata operations and across contextual processing.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: extracted metadata, organized context, provenance records, and tracking results. All outputs follow structured metadata formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/data/` through metadata interfaces, context processing, and provenance operations. Provides contextual foundation to parent data layer.

### Child Coordination
Manages metadata organization through extraction coordination, context management, and provenance results.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared contextual patterns, common document sources, and unified processing systems.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through metadata extraction: coherent context preservation ensures information understanding, dense provenance tracking provides information lineage, aligned extraction patterns maintain consistency, and measurable contextual quality through extraction accuracy.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous extraction improvement, context optimization, provenance enhancement, and tracking expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: extraction methods, context standards, provenance approaches, and tracking techniques. These invariants enable fractal metadata operation from individual records to complete contextual systems.
