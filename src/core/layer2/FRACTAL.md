# Layer 2 Evaluation - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Evaluation
- Scale: Micro
- System Role: Hydrogen-holographic PoC evaluation and tokenomics engine

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/core/layer2/` structure mirrors evaluation pipeline: `evaluator/` (scoring algorithms), `allocator/` (token distribution), archive system (redundancy), and orchestration components.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent evaluation patterns: hydrogen-holographic scoring, archive-first storage, multi-metal qualification, and token allocation. All evaluation follows Layer 2 principles and fractal assessment patterns.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/core/layer2/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors evaluation organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Evaluation ecosystem provides complete Layer 2 capability: scoring algorithms, allocation logic, archive management, and orchestration components. Each component contains complete evaluation functionality.

### Responsibility Delegation
- `evaluator/` manages hydrogen-holographic scoring
- `allocator/` handles token distribution logic
- Archive components manage redundancy
- Orchestration components coordinate evaluation

### Information Aggregation
Evaluation outputs aggregate through scoring results, allocation decisions, and archive updates through pipeline consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/core/layer2/` embodies Blueprint Layer 2: hydrogen-holographic evaluation (§3.2), token allocation (§3.3), metallic amplifications (§3.4), and archive-first redundancy (§3.1).

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of evaluation ecosystem: scoring algorithms, allocation systems, archive management, and tokenomics state.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete evaluation knowledge: hydrogen-holographic methods, allocation algorithms, archive patterns, and orchestration procedures.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Contributions enter through evaluation requests, archive queries through redundancy checks, allocation calls through token requests. All inputs follow consistent evaluation patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar evaluation processing: archive → evaluate → qualify → allocate. Pattern repeats within evaluation cycles and across Layer 2 operations.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: evaluation scores, metal qualifications, allocation amounts, and archive confirmations. All outputs follow structured evaluation formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/core/` through evaluation interfaces, allocation coordination, and Layer 2 operations. Provides evaluation foundation to parent core logic.

### Child Coordination
Orchestrates evaluation components through pipeline organization, scoring coordination, and allocation management.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared evaluation patterns, common utilities (`src/core/utils/`), and unified APIs (`src/api/`) and blockchain (`src/blockchain/`).

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through evaluation engine: measurable scoring across novelty/density/coherence/alignment dimensions, archive-first redundancy ensures information permanence, multi-metal qualification provides hierarchical categorization, epoch-based allocation creates temporal fractal patterns.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous evaluation improvement, allocation optimization, archive expansion, and AI training enhancement.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: evaluation methods, qualification logic, allocation algorithms, and archive management. These invariants enable fractal evaluation from individual contributions to complete ecosystem assessment.
