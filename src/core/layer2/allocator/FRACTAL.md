# Tokenomics Allocator - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Distribution
- Scale: Atomic
- System Role: SYNTH token allocation and epoch management systems

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/core/layer2/allocator/` contains allocation algorithms that implement epoch-based SYNTH distribution with metallic amplifications.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent allocation patterns: epoch qualification, metal multipliers, token distribution, and state management. All allocation follows tokenomics and distribution principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/core/layer2/allocator/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors allocation organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Allocation ecosystem provides complete distribution capability: epoch logic, multiplier calculations, and token assignments. Contains complete allocation functionality.

### Responsibility Delegation
- Logic manages epoch qualification
- Calculations handle multiplier applications

### Information Aggregation
Allocation outputs aggregate through distribution results, epoch updates, and token assignments through allocation consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/core/layer2/allocator/` embodies Blueprint tokenomics: epoch distribution (§3.3), metallic amplifications (§3.4), SYNTH allocation (§3.3), and multiplier systems.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of allocation ecosystem: epoch systems, multiplier logic, and distribution mechanisms.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete allocation knowledge: epoch algorithms, multiplier methods, distribution procedures, and tokenomics principles.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Evaluation results enter through allocation requests, epoch calls through distribution operations. All inputs follow consistent allocation patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar allocation processing: evaluate → qualify → multiply → distribute. Pattern repeats within allocation cycles and across distribution operations.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: token amounts, epoch confirmations, multiplier applications, and distribution records. All outputs follow structured allocation formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/core/layer2/` through allocation interfaces, distribution coordination, and tokenomics operations. Provides allocation foundation to parent Layer 2 system.

### Child Coordination
Manages allocation organization through logic coordination, calculation management, and distribution results.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared allocation patterns, common evaluation systems, and unified tokenomics state.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through tokenomics allocation: epoch qualification creates temporal fractal patterns, metallic multipliers provide hierarchical value recognition, SYNTH distribution enables regenerative ecosystem flows, and measurable allocation quality through distribution accuracy.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous logic improvement, multiplier optimization, distribution enhancement, and allocation expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: qualification methods, multiplier applications, distribution logic, and allocation approaches. These invariants enable fractal tokenomics from individual allocations to complete ecosystem distribution.
