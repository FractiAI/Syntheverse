# Hydrogen-Holographic Evaluator - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Assessment
- Scale: Atomic
- System Role: Hydrogen-holographic fractal evaluation algorithms

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/core/layer2/evaluator/` contains evaluation algorithms that implement the hydrogen-holographic fractal lens for measurable, reproducible PoC assessment.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent evaluation patterns: hydrogen-holographic scoring, dimensional assessment (novelty/density/coherence/alignment), deterministic algorithms, and measurable outputs. All evaluation follows fractal assessment principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/core/layer2/evaluator/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors evaluation organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Evaluation ecosystem provides complete assessment capability: scoring algorithms, dimensional analysis, and qualification logic. Contains complete evaluation functionality.

### Responsibility Delegation
- Algorithms manage hydrogen-holographic scoring
- Analysis handles dimensional assessment

### Information Aggregation
Evaluation outputs aggregate through scoring results, dimensional analysis, and qualification data through assessment consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/core/layer2/evaluator/` embodies Blueprint hydrogen-holographic evaluation: measurable scoring (§3.2), fractal lens (§0), dimensional assessment (§3.2), and reproducible evaluation.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of evaluation ecosystem: scoring algorithms, dimensional analysis, and qualification systems.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete evaluation knowledge: hydrogen-holographic methods, scoring algorithms, dimensional procedures, and assessment principles.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Contributions enter through evaluation requests, assessment calls through scoring operations. All inputs follow consistent evaluation patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar evaluation processing: receive → assess → score → qualify. Pattern repeats within evaluation cycles and across assessment operations.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: dimensional scores, qualification results, assessment metadata, and evaluation data. All outputs follow structured evaluation formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/core/layer2/` through evaluation interfaces, scoring coordination, and assessment operations. Provides evaluation foundation to parent Layer 2 system.

### Child Coordination
Manages evaluation organization through algorithm coordination, scoring management, and assessment results.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared evaluation patterns, common archive systems, and unified allocation logic.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest as core evaluation methodology: measurable scoring across novelty/density/coherence/alignment dimensions provides coherent assessment, deterministic algorithms ensure reproducibility, fractal lens enables measurable evaluation quality, and dimensional analysis creates hierarchical qualification patterns.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous algorithm improvement, scoring optimization, assessment enhancement, and evaluation expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: scoring methods, dimensional analysis, qualification logic, and assessment approaches. These invariants enable fractal evaluation from individual assessments to complete ecosystem evaluation.
