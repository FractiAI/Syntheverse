# Core Logic - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Engine
- Scale: Meso
- System Role: Layer 2 evaluation and business logic orchestration

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/core/` structure mirrors evaluation architecture: `layer2/` (PoC evaluation engine), `utils/` (shared utilities). Each component follows the same core logic organization pattern as parent `src/core/`.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent core patterns: evaluation algorithms, state management, utility functions, and data processing. All core operations follow Layer 2 principles and business logic patterns.

### Documentation Fractals
Each `src/core/` subdirectory follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors core organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Two core components compose business logic: Layer 2 evaluation engine provides assessment capabilities, utilities enable shared functionality. Each component contains complete core capability.

### Responsibility Delegation
- `layer2/` manages PoC evaluation and tokenomics
- `utils/` provides shared utility functions

### Information Aggregation
Core outputs aggregate through evaluation results, state updates, and utility outputs through logic consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/core/` embodies Blueprint Layer 2: PoC evaluation (§3.2), token allocation (§3.3), metallic amplifications (§3.4), and archive system (§3.1).

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of core ecosystem: evaluation engines, tokenomics systems, archive management, and utility functions.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete core knowledge: evaluation algorithms, allocation logic, state management, and utility patterns.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Contributions enter through evaluation requests, state updates through allocation calls, utility requests through function calls. All inputs follow consistent core patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar core processing: receive → evaluate → allocate → update. Pattern repeats within evaluation cycles and across core operations.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: evaluation scores, allocation results, state updates, and utility responses. All outputs follow structured core formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/` through core interfaces, evaluation APIs, and business logic operations. Provides evaluation foundation to parent source code system.

### Child Coordination
Orchestrates two child core directories through unified logic patterns, shared utilities, and coordinated operations.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared core patterns, common utilities, and unified APIs (`src/api/`) and blockchain (`src/blockchain/`).

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through core evaluation: measurable scoring algorithms ensure coherence, density assessment provides information concentration, alignment verification maintains ecosystem consistency, and measurable evaluation quality through fractal metrics.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous evaluation improvement, allocation optimization, state management enhancement, and utility expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: evaluation methods, allocation logic, state management, and utility functions. These invariants enable fractal core operation from individual functions to complete Layer 2 evaluation.
