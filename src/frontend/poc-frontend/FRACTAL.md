# POC Frontend - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Dashboard
- Scale: Micro
- System Role: Next.js dashboard and PoC interaction interface

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/frontend/poc-frontend/` structure mirrors dashboard architecture: React components that provide submission forms, evaluation displays, and interaction interfaces.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent dashboard patterns: React components, state management, user interactions, and data visualization. All dashboard operations follow Next.js and React principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/frontend/poc-frontend/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors dashboard organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Dashboard ecosystem provides complete user interface: submission components, evaluation displays, navigation systems, and interaction handlers. Each component contains complete interface capability.

### Responsibility Delegation
- Components manage specific interface functions
- State management handles data flow
- Routing enables navigation

### Information Aggregation
Dashboard outputs aggregate through component updates, user interactions, and data displays through interface consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/frontend/poc-frontend/` embodies Blueprint dashboard: PoC submission (§1.1), dashboard interaction (§1.5), user experience (§1), and visualization.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of dashboard ecosystem: submission interfaces, evaluation displays, navigation systems, and user interactions.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete dashboard knowledge: React patterns, component design, user flows, and interaction principles.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
User actions enter through component interactions, form inputs through submission handlers, navigation through routing. All inputs follow consistent React patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar dashboard processing: interact → update → render → display. Pattern repeats within user flows and across component operations.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: component updates, visual displays, user feedback, and navigation changes. All outputs follow structured React formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/frontend/` through interface components, user experiences, and dashboard operations. Provides dashboard foundation to parent frontend layer.

### Child Coordination
Manages component organization through React structure, state coordination, and interaction management.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared interface patterns, common APIs (`src/api/`), and unified user experiences.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through dashboard design: coherent information architecture ensures understanding, dense data displays provide insight concentration, aligned user flows maintain experience consistency, and measurable interaction quality through component patterns.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous component improvement, user experience optimization, interaction enhancement, and interface expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: React components, state management, interaction patterns, and user flows. These invariants enable fractal dashboard operation from individual components to complete user interfaces.
