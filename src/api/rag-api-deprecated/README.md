# DEPRECATED RAG API Directory

This directory (`rag-api/`) has been deprecated and is no longer maintained.

**Active RAG API Directory:** `../rag_api/`

The active RAG API implementation is located in the `rag_api/` directory (with underscore). This directory contains enhanced analysis tools but is not part of the active codebase.

## Migration

All references should point to `src/api/rag_api/` instead of `src/api/rag-api/`.

If you need the enhanced analysis features from this directory, consider integrating them into the active `rag_api/` directory.
