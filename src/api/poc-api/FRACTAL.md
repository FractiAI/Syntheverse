# POC API - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Service
- Scale: Micro
- System Role: PoC evaluation and submission interface

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/api/poc-api/` structure mirrors evaluation pipeline: Flask application with REST endpoints that connect frontend submissions to Layer 2 evaluation engine.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent API patterns: Flask routing, JSON request/response handling, error responses, and service integration. All endpoints follow REST principles and evaluation workflow.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/api/poc-api/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors service organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
POC API service provides complete evaluation interface: submission endpoints, evaluation routing, and result delivery. Contains complete API capability for PoC evaluation workflow.

### Responsibility Delegation
- Handles PoC submission and evaluation requests
- Routes to Layer 2 evaluation engine
- Returns evaluation results and status

### Information Aggregation
API outputs aggregate evaluation results, submission data, and system status through JSON responses and endpoint consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/api/poc-api/` embodies Blueprint evaluation interface: PoC submission (§1.1), evaluation pipeline (§1.3), and dashboard interaction (§1.5).

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of evaluation interface: submission endpoints, evaluation routing, and result delivery.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete evaluation interface knowledge: Flask routing patterns, request handling, response formatting, and Layer 2 integration.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
PoC submissions enter through POST endpoints, evaluation requests through API calls, status queries through GET endpoints. All inputs follow consistent validation patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar API processing: receive → validate → route → process → respond. Pattern repeats within evaluation workflow and across API operations.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: JSON evaluation results, status responses, error messages, and submission confirmations. All outputs follow structured API formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/api/` through unified service patterns, shared utilities, and coordinated endpoints. Provides evaluation interface to parent API layer.

### Child Coordination
Manages evaluation workflow through endpoint organization, request handling, and response coordination.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared service patterns, common utilities (`src/core/utils/`), and unified documentation.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through evaluation API design: measurable scoring endpoints, coherent request/response patterns, alignment validation, and density assessment interfaces.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous evaluation processing, API reliability improvement, interface expansion, and integration enhancement.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: Flask routing, JSON handling, error responses, and service integration. These invariants enable fractal API operation from individual endpoints to complete evaluation interface.
