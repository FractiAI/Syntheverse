# RAG Analysis CLI - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Tool
- Scale: Microscopic
- System Role: Command-line interface for alternative RAG analysis

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/api/rag-api/analysis/cli/` contains CLI tools that mirror the alternative analysis pipeline and command-line processing patterns.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent CLI patterns: command processing, analysis execution, result formatting, and tool operations. All CLI operations follow alternative and command-line principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/api/rag-api/analysis/cli/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors CLI organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
CLI ecosystem provides complete alternative capability: command processing, analysis execution, and result management. Contains complete alternative CLI functionality.

### Responsibility Delegation
- Command processing manages tool interfaces
- Analysis execution enables alternative operations

### Information Aggregation
CLI outputs aggregate through processing results, execution data, and result updates through CLI consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/api/rag-api/analysis/cli/` embodies Blueprint alternative tools: CLI interfaces (§5), analysis operations (§5), and alternative processing.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of alternative ecosystem: processing systems, execution utilities, and result frameworks.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete alternative knowledge: processing procedures, execution methods, result principles, and CLI practices.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Command inputs enter through processing requests, execution calls through CLI operations. All inputs follow consistent alternative patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar alternative processing: command → execute → process → output. Pattern repeats within CLI operations and across alternative management.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: processing confirmations, execution results, processing data, and output confirmations. All outputs follow structured alternative formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/api/rag-api/analysis/` through CLI interfaces, alternative coordination, and processing operations. Provides CLI foundation to parent alternative analysis layer.

### Child Coordination
Manages CLI organization through processing coordination, execution management, and result outputs.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared alternative patterns, common processing formats, and unified analysis systems.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through alternative CLI: coherent command processing ensures alternative alignment, dense execution capabilities provide operational concentration, aligned result patterns maintain consistency, and measurable alternative quality through processing accuracy.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous processing improvement, execution optimization, result enhancement, and CLI expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: processing methods, execution standards, result approaches, and alternative techniques. These invariants enable fractal alternative processing from individual commands to complete analysis systems.
