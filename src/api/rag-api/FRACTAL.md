# Alternative RAG API - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Service
- Scale: Micro
- System Role: Alternative document processing and RAG implementation

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/api/rag-api/` structure mirrors alternative document processing: analysis components with CLI interfaces that provide parallel RAG capabilities to primary implementation.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent alternative patterns: CLI-driven processing, analysis utilities, and query interfaces. All components follow alternative implementation and processing principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/api/rag-api/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors alternative organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Alternative RAG service provides parallel processing: analysis components with CLI interfaces for alternative document processing workflows.

### Responsibility Delegation
- `analysis/` manages alternative analysis approaches
- `cli/` provides command-line interfaces

### Information Aggregation
Alternative outputs aggregate through CLI results, analysis data, and processing reports through interface consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/api/rag-api/` embodies Blueprint alternative processing: AI integration diversity (§5), archive training variation (§5), and evaluation support alternatives.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of alternative processing: analysis variations, CLI interfaces, and processing alternatives.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete alternative processing knowledge: CLI patterns, analysis variations, processing alternatives, and implementation diversity.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Documents enter through CLI parameters, queries through command interfaces, data through processing arguments. All inputs follow consistent alternative patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar alternative processing: command → analyze → process → output. Pattern repeats within alternative pipeline and across CLI operations.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: CLI results, analysis reports, processing data, and command responses. All outputs follow structured alternative formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/api/` through unified service patterns, shared utilities, and coordinated alternatives. Provides processing diversity to parent API layer.

### Child Coordination
Orchestrates alternative components through CLI organization, command management, and result coordination.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared processing patterns, common utilities (`src/core/utils/`), and unified documentation.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through alternative processing: varied coherence approaches, different density extraction, alternative alignment methods, and diverse quality assessment.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous alternative improvement, analysis variation expansion, processing diversity enhancement, and implementation optimization.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: CLI interfaces, command processing, result formatting, and alternative approaches. These invariants enable fractal alternatives from individual variations to complete processing diversity.
