# Document Scraper - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Extraction
- Scale: Microscopic
- System Role: Web content scraping and document extraction

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/api/rag_api/scraper/` contains scraping utilities that mirror the web extraction pipeline and content gathering patterns.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent scraping patterns: URL processing, content extraction, data validation, and format conversion. All scraping operations follow extraction and processing principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/api/rag_api/scraper/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors scraping organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
Scraping ecosystem provides complete extraction capability: URL processing, content gathering, and data conversion. Contains complete scraping functionality.

### Responsibility Delegation
- URL processing manages web access
- Content gathering enables data extraction

### Information Aggregation
Scraping outputs aggregate through processing results, extraction data, and conversion updates through scraping consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/api/rag_api/scraper/` embodies Blueprint content extraction: web scraping (§5), document processing (§5), and content gathering.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of extraction ecosystem: processing systems, gathering utilities, and conversion frameworks.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete extraction knowledge: processing procedures, gathering methods, conversion principles, and scraping practices.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Web sources enter through processing requests, extraction calls through scraping operations. All inputs follow consistent extraction patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar extraction processing: access → extract → validate → convert. Pattern repeats within scraping operations and across content management.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: processing confirmations, extraction results, validation data, and conversion confirmations. All outputs follow structured extraction formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/api/rag_api/` through extraction interfaces, scraping coordination, and content operations. Provides extraction foundation to parent RAG API layer.

### Child Coordination
Manages extraction organization through processing coordination, gathering management, and conversion results.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared extraction patterns, common processing formats, and unified content systems.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through document scraping: coherent content extraction ensures information alignment, dense data gathering provides knowledge concentration, aligned processing patterns maintain consistency, and measurable extraction quality through validation accuracy.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous processing improvement, gathering optimization, conversion enhancement, and extraction expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: processing methods, gathering standards, conversion approaches, and extraction techniques. These invariants enable fractal content extraction from individual sources to complete knowledge systems.
