# RAG API - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Service
- Scale: Micro
- System Role: Document processing and RAG query interface

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/api/rag_api/` structure mirrors document processing pipeline: FastAPI application with analysis, parser, scraper, and vectorizer components that enable document ingestion and query capabilities.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent API patterns: FastAPI routing, async processing, document handling, and query interfaces. All endpoints follow document processing and RAG principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/api/rag_api/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors processing organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
RAG API service provides complete document processing: analysis components, parsing utilities, scraping interfaces, and vectorization engines. Each component contains complete processing capability.

### Responsibility Delegation
- `api/` handles FastAPI service endpoints
- `analysis/` manages document analysis
- `parser/` processes document formats
- `scraper/` extracts web content
- `vectorizer/` generates embeddings

### Information Aggregation
Processing outputs aggregate through document pipelines, analysis results, and query responses through API consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/api/rag_api/` embodies Blueprint document processing: AI integration (§5), archive training (§5), and evaluation support.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of document processing: analysis engines, parsing utilities, scraping interfaces, and vectorization systems.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes complete document processing knowledge: FastAPI patterns, analysis algorithms, parsing techniques, and vectorization methods.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Documents enter through upload endpoints, queries through API calls, URLs through scraping interfaces. All inputs follow consistent processing patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar document processing: ingest → analyze → parse → vectorize → query. Pattern repeats within processing pipeline and across API operations.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: analysis results, parsed content, embeddings, and query responses. All outputs follow structured processing formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/api/` through unified service patterns, shared utilities, and coordinated endpoints. Provides document processing to parent API layer.

### Child Coordination
Orchestrates processing components through pipeline organization, data flow management, and result coordination.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared processing patterns, common utilities (`src/core/utils/`), and unified documentation.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through document processing: coherent content analysis, dense information extraction, aligned knowledge representation, and measurable processing quality.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous processing improvement, analysis expansion, pipeline optimization, and knowledge enhancement.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: FastAPI routing, async processing, document handling, and result formatting. These invariants enable fractal processing from individual documents to complete knowledge systems.
