# RAG Analysis CLI - Fractal Analysis

## Fractal Position

- Level: Tool
- Scale: Microscopic
- System Role: Command-line interface for RAG analysis operations

## Self-Similarity Patterns

### Structural Mirroring
`src/api/rag_api/analysis/cli/` contains CLI tools that mirror the analysis pipeline and command-line interaction patterns.

### Interface Consistency
Consistent CLI patterns: command execution, parameter handling, output formatting, and tool operations. All CLI operations follow command-line and tool principles.

### Documentation Fractals
`src/api/rag_api/analysis/cli/` follows AGENTS.md + README.md + FRACTAL.md pattern, creating recursive documentation hierarchy that mirrors CLI organization.

## Recursive Organization

### Hierarchical Composition
CLI ecosystem provides tool capability: command execution, parameter processing, and output management. Contains CLI functionality.

### Responsibility Delegation
- Command execution handles tool operations
- Parameter processing manages input handling

### Information Aggregation
CLI outputs aggregate through execution results, processing data, and operation updates through tool consolidation.

## Holographic Properties

### Blueprint Reflection
`src/api/rag_api/analysis/cli/` embodies Blueprint analysis tools: RAG operations (§5), analysis processing (§5), and tool interfaces.

### System Context
Contains holographic representation of CLI ecosystem: command tools, analysis utilities, and processing interfaces.

### Knowledge Embedding
Encodes CLI knowledge: command procedures, parameter methods, execution principles, and tool practices.

## Data Flow Fractals

### Input Streams
Tool requirements enter through command requests, parameter calls through CLI operations. All inputs follow consistent CLI patterns.

### Processing Patterns
Self-similar CLI processing: command → parameter → execute → output. Pattern repeats within CLI operations and across tool management.

### Output Structures
Consistent outputs: command results, execution data, processing confirmations, and tool outputs. All outputs follow structured CLI formats.

## Scale Relationships

### Parent Integration
Integrates with `src/api/rag_api/analysis/` through CLI interfaces, command coordination, and tool operations. Provides CLI foundation to parent analysis layer.

### Child Coordination
Manages CLI organization through command coordination, parameter management, and execution results.

### Sibling Communication
Horizontal integration through shared CLI patterns, common command structures, and unified processing systems.

## Hydrogen-Holographic Manifestation

Hydrogen-holographic principles manifest through CLI tools: coherent command interfaces ensure tool alignment, dense parameter processing provides operational concentration, aligned execution patterns maintain consistency, and measurable tool quality through command accuracy.

## Regenerative Patterns

Contributes to closed-loop regeneration through: continuous command improvement, parameter optimization, execution enhancement, and tool expansion.

## Cross-Scale Invariants

Consistent patterns across scales: command methods, parameter standards, execution approaches, and tool techniques. These invariants enable fractal CLI operation from individual commands to complete tool interfaces.
